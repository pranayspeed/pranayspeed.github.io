Reinforcement Learning driving agent that learns end-to-end navigation from start to goal on 2D road maps. Implemented in PyTorch with a Kivy UI for interactive visualization, reward diagnostics, and episode playback.

Explored reward shaping and curriculum tweaks to improve lane following, collision avoidance, and convergence speed. Logged metrics and rendered trajectories to compare training variants and diagnose failure cases in intersections and sharp turns.
