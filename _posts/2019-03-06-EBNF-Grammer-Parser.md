title: BNF and EBNF Grammer Parser
---

* Implemented  Extended Backus-Naur Form grammer parser from scratch.
* Following is a sample grammer that can be parsed using this implementation:
> S := 'Hello' \| 'Hi' P \| P \| 'bye' <br />
P := 'World' | 'Everyone' | '[A-Za-z0-9]+      ' | 'a'


* Developed in Python.
