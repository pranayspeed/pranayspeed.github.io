**DAC System Design Contest 2022** – 4th place (UBPercept). Built an FPGA-friendly CNN pipeline on Ultra96V2 with quantization-aware training and deployment automation, targeting tight latency/memory budgets.

Led a 7-member team through data curation, profiling, and inference optimization; automated builds and on-board evaluation to iterate rapidly on accuracy–efficiency trade-offs. Documented lessons on model pruning and kernel fusion for edge devices.
