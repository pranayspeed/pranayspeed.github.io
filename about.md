<p class="message">
  I'm a Ph.D. student at the University at Buffalo working with <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/kdantu/">Dr. Karthik Dantu</a> at <a href="https://droneslab.github.io/">DRONES Lab</a>. My research focuses on building robust perception and planning systems for autonomous robots operating in unstructured environments.
